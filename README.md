# about me 

## my interests
I have a really good interest in cars and I also enjoy driving.
I play basketball and go to the gym if I am not working.
I picked school back up hoping to take it farther then where I left off at.

## websites I recommend 
- [BMW] (https://www.bmwusa.com)- I chose this website because I am a big bmw fan and who doesn't want a bmw? 
- [youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/)- I chose youtube because it is a platform that can help and enterain you.
